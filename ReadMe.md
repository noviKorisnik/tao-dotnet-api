The goal of this project is to show several points from development of rest web api services. It is built around dotnet core technologies and is made using VS Code (probably would not be very different if other tool was used).

At the end, service provides three endpoints for getting data for three different types of content. If we look at solution as a template, it can be used for serving structured texts, like publications.

The project is presented here with snapshot branches of development process, with readme notes with each snapshot on key points for branch. Here:
* [snapshot001](https://github.com/noviKorisnik/tao-dotnet-api/tree/snapshot001) create project
* [snapshot002](https://github.com/noviKorisnik/tao-dotnet-api/tree/snapshot002) grab contents from net, parse it in data structure and save to json file
* [snapshot003](https://github.com/noviKorisnik/tao-dotnet-api/tree/snapshot003) put data in database
* [snapshot004](https://github.com/noviKorisnik/tao-dotnet-api/tree/snapshot004) build service pipeline, repository, mapper, service, controller
