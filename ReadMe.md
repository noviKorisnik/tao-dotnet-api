## grab again?
Well, as I know, I don't have rights to distribute book of Tao so I decided to remove json copy of it from project. After all, the book itself was not the goal of the project, but what can we do with some content, Tao, for example.

Add HtmlAgilityPack, again. Add TaoParser, again. Modify BootstrapTaoDb to get Tao from TaoParser, not from json file. Remove json file. Ta-daaaa :-)
