### snapshot005
## cors
I hope we managed to provide some neat service. It would be nice if it could be used. Well, for some security concerns, default usage of service is restricted to the same domain where the service is hosted itself. So, if we want to provide additional usage, it could be done using cross-origin resource sharing (cors). The new definition goes again to Startup and it's ConfigureServices (there is added address of client which should use this service - another project, it will be linked somehow to this one).
